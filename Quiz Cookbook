QUIZ COOCKBOOK

Creating a quiz using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, PHP, PDO, phpMySQL, and JavaScript can be a complex task, but it can be broken down into several steps:

1. Design the layout of the quiz using HTML and CSS. Bootstrap 5 can be used to create a responsive and visually appealing layout.

2. Create the quiz questions and answers using PHP and store them in a MySQL database using PDO and phpMySQL.

3. Use JavaScript to create the functionality of the quiz, such as displaying questions and checking answers.

4. Connect the PHP code to the MySQL database to retrieve the questions and answers.

5. Implement logic and flow control using PHP to navigate through the quiz, track the score and display the results.

6. Test the quiz and make any necessary adjustments.

It is important to note that this is a high-level overview of the process and many details need to be considered while developing a quiz like form validation, error handling, security etc.
